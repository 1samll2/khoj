## Introduction
Welcome to the Khoj Docs! This is the best place to get setup and explore Khoj's features.

- Quickly [find](/features/search) relevant notes and documents using natural language
- It understands pdf, plaintext, markdown, org-mode files, [notion pages](/online-data-sources/notion_integration) and [github repositories](/online-data-sources/github_integration)
- Access it from your [Emacs](/clients/emacs), [Obsidian](/clients/obsidian), [Web browser](/clients/web) or the [Khoj Desktop app](/clients/desktop)
